        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I was born into a family of eight siblings in Mexico City.  My parents taught me from a very young age the importance of an education.  Although my parents lacked the opportunities to attain a higher education, they were respected in the neighborhood due to their hard work and devotion.  Despite their diligence, they would not meet the family's needs in Mexico, so we legally emigrated to California.</p>
        <p>My first job in the United States was as a migrant worker in the fields of California.  I helped my parents pick grapes, almonds, and various kinds of vegetables.  I never imagined that I would one day work in the USDA headquarters in Washington, D.C.  Proud to have had that early experience in agriculture, I valued the importance of monitoring issues with Consultative Committees on Agriculture (CCA), including Peru, Colombia, Uruguay and Argentina.  In 2004, I received a USDA Honor Award for this work.</p>
        <p>Before coming to the USDA, I received a B.A. in Political Science at California State University, and an M.A. in International Commerce and Policy at George Mason University.  I also earned an MBA in Public Administration through the USDA Public Service Scholarship Program at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
        <P>Clearly, my life’s experiences have been not only stepping-stones, but a journey every day which, for me, represents a new set of challenges as I look forward.</P>
        <p>I am passionate about everything related to business, and web developer. My best assets are my creativity, and my feeling with technology.  As a Web developer, my goal is to be able to design Web pages that can effectively display material, provide interactivity, and be artistically pleasing the user.  I believe that a successful Wed designer in the one that achieves the goals of expression, audience satisfaction and desired rewards.</p>
        <p>Today, I am determined to complete yet another challenge to successfully complete the George Washington University Boot Camp in Web Development and Programming.  This not only rounds out my education but provides me with another set of real-world skills that I can use going forward.  Education never stops, whether on or off the job, but this is a good modus operandi—companies today look for continual learners who can ply their craft and keep apace of technological developments.  I have not only followed my heart and ambitions, I have enjoyed the journey.  I have faith that the journey ahead will be equally challenging and rewarding.</p>
